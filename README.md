🏥 Healthcare Predictive Analytics – Disease Detection
📌 Project Overview

Healthcare Predictive Analytics is a machine learning–based project designed to predict the risk of diseases such as diabetes using patient medical data.
The project applies data preprocessing, normalization, classification models, and evaluation techniques to generate meaningful healthcare insights.

This project was completed as part of my Data Analytics Internship at Codec Technologies, focusing on practical implementation of predictive analytics in healthcare.

🎯 Project Objectives

Predict the likelihood of disease occurrence using medical records

Normalize and preprocess healthcare data for consistency

Apply classification algorithms for disease prediction

Analyze feature importance to identify key health indicators

Ensure ethical data handling and patient privacy
